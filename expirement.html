					BEASTS OF ENGLAND

<section>
Beasts of England! Beasts of Ireland!
</section>
<section>
Hear the hoofbeats of tomorrow!
</section>
<section>
See the golden future rise!
</section>
<section>
How does the life of an animal pass?
</section>
<section>
In endless drudgery.
</section>
<section>
What's the first lesson an animal learns?
</section>
<section>
To endure its slavery.
</section>
<section>
How does the life of an animal end?
</section>
<section>
In cruel butchery.
</section>
<section>
Beasts of England! Beasts of Ireland!
</section>
<section>
Beasts of land and sea and skies!
</section>
<section>
Hear the hoofbeats of tomorrow!
</section>
<section>
See the golden future rise!
</section>
<section>
Now the day of beasts is coming,
</section>
<section>
Tyrant man shall lose his throne
</section>
<section>
And the shining fields of England
</section>
<section>
Shall be trod by beasts alone.
</section>
<section>
Pull the rings from out your noses
</section>
<section>
Tear the saddle from your back!
</section>
<section>
Bit and spur must rust forever,
</section>
<section>
Cruel whips no more shall crack.
</section>
<section>
Beasts of England, seize the prizes,
</section>
<section>
Wheat and barley, oats and hay,
</section>
<section>
Clover, beans and mangel wurzel
</section>
<section>
Shall be ours upon that day.
